# AC.2.1.11 - \[\] REMOVAL OF TEMPORARY ACCOUNTS

## Control Statement

The information system automatically  disables temporary accounts after 1 day.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and emergency accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather than at the convenience of the systems administrator.
