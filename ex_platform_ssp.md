Ex Platform SSP

# Ex Platform overview
This is the frontmatter for the EC Drupalcreate System Security Plan

<!-- This iterates over the controls in a resolved catalog and prints out the control statement, summary table,
and implemented requirements 

The groups are sorted by id and the controls are sorted within each group by sort-id if defined for the control.

The control tables for parameters are output with the param_id in the first column followed either by a single
'Values' column, or two columns: 'Values' and 'Label or Choice'.  In the one-column case, values are listed if available
and if not the descriptive label is shown, unless the parameter has a Select defined, in which case the choice options
are shown.

In the two-column case the Values column is empty if no values are defined, and the Label or Choice column is either the
list of optional choices if the parameter has a Select defined, else just the descriptive label for the parameter.

To choose the one- or two- column option, specify false or true, respectively, as the final parameter in
get_fedramp_control_tables().
